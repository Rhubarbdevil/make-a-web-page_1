        <h3>The Web (i.e. the Internet)</h3>
          The web consists of:<br>
          <em>Servers</em> --> hold the content (HTML documents)<br>
          <em>HTTP requests</em> --> sent from browser to server to get the correct HTML docs<br>
          <em>Browsers</em> --> interpret the HTML docs for a user's computer<br>
          <em>Computers</em> --> where people interact with the internet (via browsers)<br>

        <h3>HTML</h3>
          <p>
            HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.
            While there are many types of documents (text, images, videos, etc.) 
            on the web, HTML docs are the main type of document making up the internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML is made up of:<br>
            <em>Text content</em> (what you see on webpages)<br>
            <em>Markup</em> (what the text looks like - its formatting)<br>
            <em>References to other documents</em> (e.g. images and videos)<br>
            <em>Links</em> (to other webpages) 
          </p>
          <p>
            Markup is made of tags. Tags are indicated by angle brackets.<br>
            An opening tag + contents + closing tag is an <b>element</b>:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>element = &lt;tag&gt; contents &lt;/tag&gt;</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Attributes</b> go inside tags and assign the tag a value. For instance,
            &lt;a&gt; is the anchor tag. If you add the href attribute, and assign
            a web address, you have created a link. The text of the link will
            be whatever is in the contents of the tag.
          </p>
          <p>
            IMAGE tags (img) are an example of <b>void</b> tags. That means they don't
            have closing tags. Void tags have no content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Image tags have two attributes, the source (src) -- a web address 
            where the image is stored -- and an alternate (alt), which is what
            will be shown in the event of a broken request (usually "text").
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML treats all whitespace as a single space. That means tags are 
            necessary to create formatting and whitespace.
          </p>
          <p>
            &lt;br&gt; &lt;/br&gt; is the tag for a line break<br>
            &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; is the tag for a paragraph
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two different types of line/paragraph tag, because they
            are functionally different. br is an <b>inline tag</b> -- it just ends the
            line of text. p is a <b>block tag</b>. Block tags create a "box" around the contents of the tag.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML docs generally consist of a HEAD and a BODY. The head contains 
            metadata about the doc, while the body contains the actual content (what 
            will appear on the web).

        <h3>Structure and Style</h3>
        
          <p>HTML and CSS are both languages. HTML files are the <em>structure</em> of a website, while CSS files provide the <em>style</em>.</p>
          
          <p><b>Analogy</b>: HTML is like the walls, floors and ceilings, while CSS is like the color of the walls and how it's decorated.</p>
          
          <p>HTML docs have a "tree-like" structure. This structure is the Document Object Model, or <b>DOM</b>.</p>
          
          <p>HTML turns tags into elements in the DOM.</p>
          
          <p>Webpages can be broken down into boxes. One of the first steps of analyzing a webpage is to "boxify" it, 
          or identify all the boxes used or planned to be used.</p>

      <div class="Topic">
        <h3>General Note</h3>
          <p>
            You must always use &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
            at the top of your document, before the &lt;html&gt; tag. 
          </p>
        <h3>Styling and CSS</h3>
          <p>
          </p>
            <h4>CSS Controls the Style of HTML</h4>
              <p>
              CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. "Cascading" because the computer looks down through all the rules
              until it finds the one most specific to that element. That rule then gets applied.
              
              </p>
            <h4>How to Use CSS</h4>
              <p>There are three ways to add CSS to your HTML doc:</p>
                <p>1. You can write CSS in the &lt;head&gt; of your document. To do this, you add a &lt;style&gt; &lt;/style&gt; element to 
                your document above the &lt;html&gt;.<br>
                2. You can create a separate CSS file and &lt;link&gt; it to the HTML document
              in order to add style.<br>
                3. You can write your style inline with your HTML</p>
            <h4>Why #3 Above is a BAD IDEA</h4>
              <p>Repetition. If you write your style inline with your HTML, you will have
                to potentially add the same style/code over and over and over again. No one wants
                to do that, and no one respects coders who do that. The great thing about computers
                is they let you automate tedious tasks. So, instead of re-writing the same style code
                over and over, you can simply assign that style to a <b>selector</b> (an element type
                or a class that you assign to an element.) The computer will
                then style any instance of that selector the same way.
              </p>
            <h4>Inheritance</h4>
              <p>Inheritance is a key feature of CSS. Any styling assigned an element
                is "inherited" by any element contained inside the styled element. For
                instance, if &lt;h1&gt; is styled to be blue, and the element <b>&lt;em&gt;<em>for 
                example</em>&lt;/em&gt;</b> is inside an &lt;h1&gt; heading, if no other styling
                is assigned to &lt;em&gt; elements, it will inherit the blut styling from the heading.
              </p>
                
              <p> Generally speaking, any text-related properties are inherited, but
                box-related properties are not.
              </p>
            <h4>Clarifying Div and Span</h4>
              <p>
                &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; are both containers. The &lt;div&gt; tag is a block tag, and is used
                to control layout (think boxes). The &lt;span&gt; tag is inline, and is used to style
                text (i.e. text decorations and enclosing inline elements).
              </p>
            <h4>ID's and Classes</h4>
              <p><em>id</em> is an attribute that uniquely identifies an element. <em>class</em> is an attribute
                that styles things that are similar to each other.
              </p>
            <h4>The Box Model</h4>
              <img src="http://i.imgur.com/t6DjmK5.gif" title="source: imgur.com" alt="Box Model" height=256>
              <p>
                It can be hard to space your boxes correctly, because they have margins,
                borders and padding around the content. There are two ways to handle box size issues:
              </p>
                
              <p>
                1. Set box sizes in terms of percentages, not pixels<br>
                2. Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box
              </p>
                <h5><em>Flex Box</em></h5>
                  <p>
                    Adding the rule display: flex to all elements will override the rule
                    that makes each div take up the width of the page. This allows side-by-side
                    boxes.

      <h3>Coding Methodolgy</h3>
        <h4>Code, Test, Refine</h4>
          <p>
            The basic methodology for writing programs is to write code, test it, then refine.
            Tips for approaching your web page:
          </p>
          <p>
            1. Work on the structure and get it right - BOXIFY<br>
            2. Work on the tags<br>
            3. Work on the size of the boxes<br>
            4. Work on the positioning of the boxes<br>
            5. Work on the smaller details
          </p>
          <p>
            To reiterate:
          </p>
          <p>
            1. Look for natural boxes
            2. Look for repeated styles and semantic elements
            3. Write the HTML
            4. Apply your styles from BIGGEST to smallest
            5. Fix the details
          </p>
          <p>
            Use dev tools during your testing and refining.
